# TODO

- fix grab exit/hover exit bug
- move all selections at once?
- billboard labels...

- undo system
    - not priority, but better to implement a skeleton now than later

- move nodes back on surface deletion
- when using voice, attach cluster not based on cluster pos
- replicate cluster/node
- find out how to include props as anonymous types
- way to generate lambda functions from criteria? e.g. create linear scale colorer from attribute name and color

- refactor surface
- select groups using minimap

- move surfaces with things
